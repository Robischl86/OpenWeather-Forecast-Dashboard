## Description
This is an HTML page that provides a city's current weather information and projected five-day forecasts. The application uses the OpenWeather API to display the current and five-day forecast weather information for any city that the user enters into the text field.

## Installation
There are no Node.js packages that need to be installed.
## Usage
Enter the name of any recognized city in the OpenWeatherMap database and then click the search button or press Enter. The city's current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index rating will appear below a weather icon in the dashboard display. The projected five-day weather patterns will be presented in the form of icons, temperature, and humidity. Every new city searched will also create on-click buttons that correspond to that city's weather information and are saved to the local storage, allowing you to quickly access that city's weather information.

## Questions
Q: How do I search for a city?
A: Enter the name of any U.S. or international city into the search field at the bottom portion of the dashboard display.

Q: What frameworks and/or API's were used in the development of this project?
A: The styling comes from the Bootstrap CSS library. The script uses moment.js to display dates and uses the JSON format of the OpenWeatherMap API's for Current Weather Data, 5 day Forecast, and UV Index.

Q: What temperature scale can I view the results in?
A: For now, the only scale used in the temperature display is Fahrenheit.
